/*
 * The implementation here warrants an explantation. The hessenberg reduction
 * returns two matrices, a P and an H. P is a unitary matrix and H is "nearly"
 * an upper triangular matrix. Most implementations are iterative, but as
 * iterative implementations in constexpr functions are difficult or impossible,
 * that leaves recursion. The hessenberg implementation requires the original
 * matrix A to be modified at each step, stepping down through the matrix
 * dimensions. This proves to be a problem for a recursive implementation
 * because the matrix which gets modified must be continuously decreasing in
 * its dimension, but if it is required to multiply by A at each step, A _can't_
 * get smaller. This is why L is passed in as a template parameter, so that the
 * A continuously sized A matrix can be passed at each recursive step all the
 * while the sub matrix by which it's multiplied can decrease in size.
 *
 * Of course, recursive implementations in templated functions must be provided
 * an explicit specialization to end the recursion. Unfortunately because we
 * know that recursion should end with the matrix by which we are going to
 * multiply is of size 2x2, but b/c A isn't changing in size, it forces us to
 * require a partially specialized templated function, which isn't possible.
 * Instead, we use the trick here:
 * https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/08/11/how-to-do-partial-template-specialization-in-c/
 *
 * Partial specialization of structs _is_ allowed, so we exploit that fact and
 * have a function return a struct, where the struct is nothing more than the
 * specialized implementation.
